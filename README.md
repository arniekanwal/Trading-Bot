# Trading Bot Project

## Bots

Current implementation will allow for two types of bots:
1. Reddit Scraper
2. Trading Bot

The reddit scraper will take user parameters to confine its search and return qualitative financial that may inform user trading/strategy. The trading bot will connect to a brokerage service and run according to a user defined strategy. This can be used live or for backtesting (paper-trading).

## REST API

Provide a REST API service through which users can interact with trading bots (create bot instance, tune bot parameters, recieve data/messages, stop bots, etc...)
